# 🏥 COVID Seat Management System in Hospitals

An embedded system project that simulates a real-world hospital check-in and triage system during the COVID-19 pandemic. Built using Python and the `engi1020.arduino` library, this system uses Arduino components to interact with patients and doctors, automating seat assignment and data logging based on COVID risk levels.

## 🔧 Features
- Touch and button input to identify doctors and patients
- Interactive LCD display with color-coded zone assignments (Red for suspected COVID, Blue for general patients)
- Servo motor control for automatic sanitizer dispensing
- Real-time data logging for doctors to view patient records
- Decision tree logic to assess COVID risk based on symptoms and exposure

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools
- Python
- Arduino with `engi1020.arduino` library
- Digital and analog sensors (button, touch, temperature)
- Servo motor
- RGB LCD

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Connect Arduino sensors and components to appropriate digital and analog pins.
2. Install the `engi1020.arduino` Python module (available in Memorial University's ENGI 1020 environment).
3. Run the Python script to simulate patient/doctor check-in.
